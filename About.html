            ‘Satara Tourism’ has been created for travellers.

It focuses mainly on the promotion of tourism through public and private participation and improving the infrastructure and standard of tourist places. Satara Tourism works through local governments.

We focus on information dissemination, local basic infrastructure projects, promotion of paying guest schemes, heritage conservation and preservation, coordination of tourism clubs, creation of tourism awareness and preparation of host community to enhance the standard of tourist destinations and perk up the tourism sector.

‘Satara Tourism’ plays a vital role in the development of tourism packages involving religious destinations which has a real sense of spirituality. With the presence of several religious places of worship in Satara, it is an important aspect of Satara Tourism’s design.

We constantly come up with novel ideas and events to add freshness and vigour to society, both in India and the world.
